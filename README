******************************* README ***********************************
This is a device and a vendor setup to allow the building of AOSP Code for
a Droid2 device.  Use this at your own risk.

Clone, download, or pull this device into your device/motorola/ directory.
Verify ADB is running and run ./extract-files.sh

I must give credit to Koush and Cvpcs for help, guidelines, and borrowed
code.  I could not have created this without their assistance.

Use this device at your own risk.  At anytime it may be incomplete or
broken, and may lead to phone that refuses to boot. I take no responsibilty
for any damage that may come of attempting to use this.

				NOTE:
Inorder for the hijack portion to build, repos from places other than AOSP
maybe required.
